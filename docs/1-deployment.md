4. Register a Route 53 domain (you will later use the domain name with the Twine client library)
</details>

## Request a TLS Certificate
<details>
<summary>Step-by-step guide</summary>

## Deploy the Twine Architecture
<details>
<summary>Step-by-step guide</summary>
<!--All you need is a blank line-->

1. Clone this repository
2. Open your terminal
3. Navigate to the repository directory 
4. Execute `aws configure list`
5. If the 'Name' value is not your newly-created AWS CLI profile name, execute `export AWS_PROFILE=new-profile-name` (this command is different for Windows users)
6. Execute `aws configure list` again to confirm the change occurred
7. Execute `npm install` to install the Twine deployment dependencies
8. Execute `npm start` to launch the deployment process
9. Follow the instructions in your terminal

The creation process can be observed in the 'Stacks' section of the AWS Cloud Formation page. After the process is complete, the Twine server will be running in the Elastic Beanstalk environment. However, to satisfy browser requirements, Twine must use your newly-created domain name instead of the load balancer endpoint.

## Create a DNS Record
<details>
<summary>Step-by-step guide</summary>
<!--All you need is a blank line-->

1. Enter the [AWS Console](http://console.aws.amazon.com) and search for 'Route 53'
2. Click 'Hosted Zones' in the AWS Route 53 sidebar
3. Click on the listed domain name
4. Click 'Create Record'
5. Ensure the Record Type is 'A' then click 'Alias'
6. Set the 'Endpoint' to 'Alias to Application and Classic Load Balancer'
7. Select the region name that you previously determined
8. Select the single option for 'Choose Load Balancer'
9. Click 'Create Records'
</details>

Record creation will take a few minutes. The Twine architecture will then be complete and ready for the Twine server/client library implementation. Please note that Twine issues third-party cookies for sticky sessions and to store WebSocket session data for connection state recovery. Your Twine API key (required to publish to the Twine API) is available on your newly-created AWS Secrets Manager page.
